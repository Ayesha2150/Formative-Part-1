      <h3>Why Education Matters</h3>
      <p>
        At the SPCA Cape of Good Hope, we believe that true change starts with knowledge. 
        By teaching individuals, families, and communities about the importance of animal welfare, 
        we plant the seeds of kindness and compassion. Education helps prevent cruelty, reduce neglect, 
        and create a society where both animals and people can thrive together.
      </p>

      <h3>Our Programs and Resources</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong> School Visits:</strong> Our outreach team regularly visits schools to inspire young learners about empathy, kindness, and responsible pet ownership.</li>
        <li><strong> Community Campaigns:</strong> We run awareness drives in local communities to highlight issues like proper pet care, the dangers of animal abuse, and the importance of vaccination.</li>
        <li><strong> Workshops:</strong> Our workshops equip volunteers, animal lovers, and future foster parents with the skills and knowledge they need to support animal welfare efforts effectively.</li>
